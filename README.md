Welcome to **SmirkingFace**, an LLM-powered penetration testing tool designed to uncover security vulnerabilities and enhance the security posture and compliance of individuals and organizations.

### 🚨 Disclaimer

This tool is **intended for responsible and lawful use only**. Users are solely accountable for their activities and compliance with applicable laws and terms of service (ToS). Misuse or illegal usage may violate platform ToS or legal standards.

### 📜 Project Summary

**SmirkingFace** leverages advanced Language Models (LLMs) to perform comprehensive penetration testing in a multi-step process:

1. **Initial Scanning**: Runs initial scans on a target to gather information and build a detailed security profile.
2. **Credential Testing**: Attempts login using common or known credentials based on scan results.
3. **Exploit Execution**: Downloads, modifies, and executes proof-of-concept exploit code tailored to the target system.

The project also explores state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, inspired by academic research, to increase efficacy for security-focused use cases. This includes but is not limited to:

- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Optimizing LLMs for penetration testing.
- **LoRAs**: Leveraging low-rank adaptation for efficient model updates.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for security scenarios.
- **Computer Vision**: Using vision models where relevant for security tasks.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG)**: Enhancing model performance by integrating external knowledge sources.
- **Frameworks and Infrastructures**: Utilizing existing tools for code execution, environment management, and security analysis.
